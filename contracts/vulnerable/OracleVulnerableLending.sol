// This contract is vulnerable to oracle manipulation attacks.
// An attacker can manipulate the oracle price during a flash loan to borrow more tokens than they should
// This can lead to draining the contract of its funds, as the collateral required is based on  the manipulated price.
// Users should avoid using contracts that rely on untrusted external oracles for critical operations like lending
// and borrowing, as they can be exploited by malicious actors.
